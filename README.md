# OIM_7502 - Midterm

### Library Overview
PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library for Python. It provides a flexible framework for building and training deep learning models.​
At its core, PyTorch provides two main features:​
An n-dimensional Tensor, similar to numpy but can run on GPUs​
Automatic differentiation for building and training neural networks​

It is widely used for various applications such as natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and reinforcement learning. PyTorch also offers dynamic computational graphs along with automatic differentiation.​


### To get started install Pytorch on your computer:
Visit https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/
Download and install the version for your operating system
OR Use this code
  pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
  import torch
  import torchvision



### To access files you can open them in the browser by clicking on the file desired, but it is best to copy them to your own computer:
Locate the green code button and click it

Copy the URL and open git bash (terminal for MAC OS)

Type git clone and then paste the URL and hit enter

Alternatively you can directly enter:

git clone https://github.com/mjmacarty/OIM7502_SP24.git



### To update the folder on your computer:
Launch git bash (terminal in MAC OS)

Navigate to the repository on your computer

Enter:

git pull https://github.com/mjmacarty/OIM7502_SP24.git
